Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?


The client in this situation is Artemis Financial who deals in developing individual financial plans for savings, retirement, investment, and insurance for their patrons.  What they wanted was to increase their security for the system to protect their client’s information. 


What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?


What I did well in the project was implementing the check on the dependencies in addition to adding the exceptions. With the exceptions, research had to be done on the specific API to make sure the API was not harmful to the project. Its important to code security because if there is private information being inputted into the project, it needs to be protected from hackers. By having security, the company will have a better reputation with the consumer, ensuring all information that is given is being protected. 


What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?


What I found the most challenging with the vulnerability assessment is the checksum part. It was difficult to get the system to accept the process. I had to use multiple IDEs to get the project to run correctly. 


How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?


To increase the layers of security what I did was use a hash and SHA256 to encrypt the information. This would ensure the information was protected with a high level of security. The strategy I would use in the future would be to create a separate class for the security so if anything goes wrong the entire program wouldn’t be a failure. 


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


What I did to ensure there were not any new vulnerabilities was to check the dependencies often to make sure there is not a new way of attacking the program. With each build, id look at the dependencies and have the previous one still open to make sure no new threats are created. 


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?


The tool that I found most useful was the maven dependency report. This helped find out which API has any bugs or ways of getting into the system. This will be very helpful in future projects that require a lay of security. 


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?


What I would show case to a future employee would be the research I did to make sure each dependency was safe or needed to be changed.  By using the maven dependency report, I did research on each different dependency to make sure its safe for the said project.
